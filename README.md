Hi everyone! I'm **Thang Phan** and I'm a student at UCSD majoring in computer science graduating in *2022*. I'm an aspiring Product Manager and Entrepreuneur. My main career interests are product management, product design, and strategy/operations. Visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thangmichaelphan/) for a brief overview of my background. ~~Also, I know how to code really well!~~ Just kidding, I also know no code. I am trying to learn though and hopefully I'll know at least how to code a simple web page. **When its 2022, contact me, and if I don't know how to code a simple web page by then I will personally give you a dollar**

[My favorite fast food](#favorite-fast-food)

```
function test() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```
(I don't even know what programming language the above code is in hehe)

One of my all time favorite quotes is the following
>  “Genius is 1% talent and 99% percent hard work...”

This quote really resonates with me because although I do possess a 4.0, I still think I am probably the least talented computer science student at UCSD. Currently, I attribute my academic success to the following:
- Studying at least 2x more than my "smartest" peers
- Going to office hours whenever possible
- Willpower and Grit aka studying those extra late or morning hours even when I feel like total poop

As you can tell this Github page is really just all over the place. This is because I need to include various markdown elements in it for an assigment for my CSE 110 software engineering class *which by the way I am extremely excited to take despite knowing no code* For my assignment I need to have an ordered and nested list so the ordered list you see if the rankings of my favorite fast food restaurants and the nested list will be a list of my favorite classes and why I liked them

## Favorite Fast Food
1. In-N-Out
2. Chipotle 
3. Raising Canes
4. McDonalds
5. Chick-Fil-A

## Favorite Classes
1. CSE 20
   - One of first theory / proof based CSE course I've taken
   - Really learned that UC college CSE courses are on another level
   - Learned to utilize office hours
2. CSE 30 
   - Was a really challenging course 
     - I spend 5 days straight studying 12 hours a day to prepare for the final
   - Got a taste of low level programming
   - Met my best friend Steven Steiner
3. CSE 190
   - Learned that products are successful if the customer wants it
   - The idea my group came up gave birth to one of the startups I work on now
   - Professor gave my team a recommendation into the NSF I-corp program (Thanks Professor Kumar)
